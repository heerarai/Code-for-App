# Code-for-App
# Social Skills Trainer App (Backend)

This is the backend of a web-based Social Skills Trainer app designed to help autistic children and others with special needs improve their social understanding through interactive, scenario-based learning. The project aims to deliver tailored experiences using adaptive difficulty and tone detection systems.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **FastAPI** â€“ Python web framework for building APIs
- **Python** â€“ Core language for backend logic
- **Uvicorn** â€“ ASGI server for running FastAPI apps
- **Tone Detection** â€“ Basic NLP model (will be improved using ML in future versions)

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Serves randomized social scenarios (categorized by environment: home, school, friends, etc.)
- Receives user responses and tracks answers
- Adjusts difficulty level dynamically
- Image-based visual learning
- Progress and level tracking (in development)
- Future integration: Enhanced tone detection using NLP/ML (PyTorch)

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heerarai/Code-for-App.git
